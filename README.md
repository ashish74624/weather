# React Weather App

This is a React application that displays weather information using data from an external API. The app is built using Tailwind CSS for styling and incorporates images from Unsplash to enhance the visual experience.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/ashish74624/weather.git`.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory: `cd your-repo`.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.
5. Obtain an API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) by signing up for a free account.
6. In the `.env` file, add your API key using the following format: `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key`.
7. Save the file.
8. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
9. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Usage

Upon opening the app, you will be prompted to enter the name of a location. The app will then fetch the weather data from the external API and display the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition. Additionally, an image related to the weather condition will be displayed.

Please note that the data provided by the app might not be totally accurate as it utilizes a free API. For more accurate and reliable weather data, consider upgrading to a paid subscription of the WeatherAPI service.
